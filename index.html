      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML structures the page of a website; it is the building blocks of a website</li>
        <li>HTML showcases how a user will view a website but it is hardly seen on a surface level</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
        <li>The body element contains content that can be viewed by a user, such as text, images, or links/hyperlinks</li>
        <li>ol=ordered or numbered lists; ul=bulleted lists; li=listed items</li>
        <li>The p tag creates a paragraph, the br tag creates a break or separation between lines or paragraphs</li>
        <li>Decides how and what to display, how big the display or text will be, what character sets can be used, what images will be shown, and more</li>
        <li>UTF-8 is the best character set to use as it includes the most commonly used characters and more</li>
        <li>img src: adds an image to the page using HTML; alt: explains what the image is</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Different styles of CSS are performed in different ways:</li>
        <ol class="customIndent">
          <li>Inline style: CSS is done within a specific tag of HTML; stylizes the tag specifically and only said tag</li>
          <li>Internal style: CSS is done in the head of the HTML, and typically is the design for the entire page</li>
          <li>External style: CSS is done in a separate file and connected to the HTML through a link in the head of the HTML file</li>
        </ol>
        <li>The color, size, location, and alignment can be altered with CSS</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside of an element</li>
        <li>By using the class attribute in HTML, External CSS can be used to design everything within an element that contains the specific class attribute</li>
        <li>Color can be chosen using hexadecimal (hex) values OR by simply typing in the desired color; hexadecimal colors will be more exact</li>

        <li>git branch -d branch-name: deletes a branch; will not delete if content is not added to main branch yet</li>
        <li>Git Flow, which includes the steps below, helps keep everything properly stored, updated, and in working order</li>
        <li>git add -A: commits all files in the working branch and stages them to be moved</li>
        <li>git commit -m: commits above mentioned files to the repository; the flag -m adds a message to the commit about changes implemented</li>
        <li>git pull origin main (or other branch-name): pulls any updated code from the main branch (or other branch) into the feature branch; important to do before adding changes</li>
        <li>git push origin branch-name: pushes changes to GitHub, making it possible to open a PR (pull request) so that, after peer reviews, a branch can be merged to the main branch</li>
