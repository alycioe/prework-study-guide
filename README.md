# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guide webpage is a starting point in my journey toward working with computers, learning how to code, and understanding and implementing the language of technology.
As a person who started with very little background, this website contains the first of many future efforts at creating code that I can use to design websites, applications, and whatever other paths the world of coding will bring to me.
Through this webpage, I reverse engineered code, followed instructions, and came out with a fully functional site that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while using Git Bash and GitHub as well.
Everything visible in the webpage was learned throughout the course of creating this study guide so that the me of the future can compare what I did at the beginning with whatever I am capable of doing someday.

## Usage

This webpage contains entry level information about the topics HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
Each section compiles a list of the things I believed were the most necessary to memorize as I enter the world of coding.
By opening the DevTools console by pressing Control+Shift+I for Windows or Command+Option+I for macOS, the Javascript will be found by listing off the topics as well as randomizing a topic to study on the last line.
